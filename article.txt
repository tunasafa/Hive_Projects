darius killa looked at the perfect sword in his hands and felt happy.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his eternal surroundings. 
He had always loved nice valhalla with its homeless, heavy heaven.
 It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone.
 It was the figure of volde mort.
 volde was a fair monster with glowing arms and jacked head.

darius gulped. He glanced at his own reflection.
 He was a nice, smart, vodka drinker with fit arms and athletic head.
 His friends saw him as a light, little legend.
  Once, he had even helped a squealing queen cross the road.

But not even a nice person who had once helped a squealing queen
 cross the road, was prepared for what volde had in store today.

The snow flurried like running giants, making darius positive.

As darius stepped outside and volde came closer, he could see the sad smile on his face.

"I am here because I want revenge," volde bellowed, in a caring tone.
 He slammed his fist against darius's chest, with the force of 8916 tigers.
 "I frigging hate you, darius killa."

darius looked back, even more positive and still fingering the perfect sword. "volde, I know your secret," he replied.

They looked at each other with relaxed feelings, like two depressed,
 determined dinasaurs fighting at a very wise orc war, 
which had baroc classical music music playing in the background and two
 no mercy uncles chanting to the beat.

Suddenly, volde lunged forward and tried to punch darius in the face.
 Quickly, darius grabbed the perfect sword and brought it down on volde's skull.

volde's glowing arms trembled and his jacked head wobbled.
 He looked trust, his body raw like an abundant, adventurous ax.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground.
 Moments later volde mort was dead.

darius killa went back inside and made himself a nice shot of vodka.

THE END

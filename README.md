# Hive Helsinki Project Showcase

This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects completed as part of the Hive Helsinki programming curriculum. It serves as a showcase of the skills and knowledge acquired, demonstrating a journey from fundamental C programming to advanced concepts in C++, computer graphics, and system administration.

## Repository Overview

The projects in this repository are diverse, covering a wide range of topics in software engineering. They are organized into three main categories:

- **C Projects:** These projects form the foundation of the curriculum, focusing on core computer science concepts, algorithms, data structures, and low-level systems programming in C.
- **C++ Projects:** A series of modules that explore the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), from basic syntax and classes to advanced topics like polymorphism, templates, and exception handling.
- **DevOps Projects:** This category contains projects focused on system administration and infrastructure, utilizing modern tools like Docker to build and manage multi-service applications.

## Technologies and Concepts

This repository demonstrates proficiency in a variety of technologies and fundamental computer science concepts, including:

- **Languages:** C, C++
- **Core Concepts:**
  - **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Sorting algorithms, linked lists, stacks.
  - **Systems Programming:** Process management (`fork`, `execve`), inter-process communication (pipes, signals), file I/O, and memory management.
  - **Object-Oriented Programming:** Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, templates, and exception handling.
  - **Computer Graphics:** Ray tracing, fractal generation, and 3D vector mathematics.
  - **Concurrency:** Multithreading, mutexes, deadlocks, and race conditions.
- **Tools & Technologies:**
  - **Build Automation:** Makefiles
  - **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
  - **Web Stack:** Nginx, MariaDB, WordPress
  - **Libraries:** MinilibX, Readline

# Hive Projects

This repository is a collection of C/C++ and DevOps projects, each located in its own directory. Every project includes a dedicated `README.md` file with detailed information about the project's concepts, compilation, and execution.

## Projects Overview

The projects are categorized into two main groups: C/C++ and DevOps.

### C/C++ Projects

These projects focus on fundamental concepts of computer science and software engineering, implemented in C and C++.
